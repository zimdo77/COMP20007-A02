    Make using

    Run using
        ./problem2d dictionary board
    
    where dictionary is the name of the file with the 
        dictionary of words in the expected format (e.g. 
        test_cases/2d-1-dict.txt), and board is the name
        of the file containing the boggle board, for 
        example:
    
        ./problem2d test_cases/2d-1-dict.txt test_cases/2d-1-board.txt
